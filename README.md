# 🧠 Brain Tumor & Alzheimer Disease Detection with Deep Learning

This project aims to build an image classification system that can detect **brain tumors** and **Alzheimer’s disease stages** from MRI images using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to support early diagnosis by providing accurate predictions based on medical imaging.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of MRI brain scan images divided into the following classes:

### 🧠 Alzheimer Classes:
- `alzheimer_mild_demented`
- `alzheimer_moderate_demented`
- `alzheimer_non_demented`
- `alzheimer_very_mild_demented`

### 🎯 Tumor Classes:
- `tumor_yes`
- `tumor_no`

> Augmentation has been applied only to **tumor_yes** and **tumor_no** classes to balance the dataset and avoid overfitting.

## 🔍 Project Flow

### ✅ Step 1: Data Loading & Structure Visualization
- ZIP file manually uploaded and extracted in Colab.
- Folder structure printed and random sample images visualized.

### ✅ Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Images resized to `64x64` or `96x96` depending on the model.
- Normalization performed using `pixel / 255.0`.
- Labels encoded using a mapping dictionary.
- Train-test split applied (80/20, stratified).

### ✅ Step 3: Data Augmentation
- Custom augmentation techniques applied separately using:
  - `ImageDataGenerator` for `tumor_no`
  - `Albumentations` for `tumor_yes`

### ✅ Step 4: Model Development

**Implemented Models:**
- ✅ Baseline CNN
- ✅ MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Albumentations
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## 📎 How to Run

1. Upload your dataset ZIP manually to Google Colab.
2. Run the notebook cells step by step.
3. If resuming, upload `.h5` or `.keras` models manually to avoid re-training.
4. Run evaluation cells directly to visualize results.
